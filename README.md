# Team_Chaos - Churn Predictor 

**Hackathon Project: Aeravat 1.0 at SPIT**

**Predict Customer Churn and Retain Happy Users**

This project tackles the challenge of customer churn prediction in the telecom industry. By identifying subscribers at risk of leaving, telecom companies can take proactive steps to retain them and boost customer loyalty.

**Getting Started**

This project leverages Python's powerful data science ecosystem. To set up your environment, install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Project Structure**

data: Houses the raw and processed customer data.
notebooks: Immerse yourself in data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation through Jupyter Notebooks.
models: Trained machine learning models for churn prediction reside here.
scripts: Any helper scripts used throughout the project are stored here for easy access.
requirements.txt: A list of essential Python libraries for running the project.
README.md: The file you're currently reading (looking good, by the way!).

**Project Overview**

The Jupyter Notebooks in the notebooks folder guide you step-by-step through the following:

Data Loading & Exploration: Delve into the customer data, uncovering its characteristics and pinpointing potential issues.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Ensure data quality by handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical features.
Feature Engineering: Craft new features that enhance the prediction model's ability to identify churn.
Model Training & Evaluation: Train various machine learning algorithms to compete for the title of "best churn predictor." Evaluate each model's performance using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model Selection: Based on the evaluation results, crown the champion model!

➡️ **Running the Notebooks**

Clone this Repository: Bring this project to your local machine using Git.
Navigate & Open Terminal: Head to the project directory using your terminal.
Jupyter Notebook Server: Launch the server using jupyter notebook.
Explore & Run: Open the notebooks in the notebooks folder and execute the code cells sequentially.

**Further Exploration**

Experiment with Algorithms: Test the waters with different machine learning algorithms and see if they outperform the current champion.
Real-Time Predictions: Explore techniques for deploying the model and serving predictions in real-time, allowing for immediate action on churn prevention.
Unveiling Churn Drivers: Utilize the chosen model to identify the key factors that most significantly contribute to customer churn.
This project equips you with a solid foundation for building a robust customer churn prediction system. Feel free to tailor it to your specific needs and data to create a truly impactful solution!


**Key improvements and considerations:**

- **Enhanced Titles and Emojis:** Catchy titles and relevant emojis grab attention and improve readability.
- **Concise Structure:** The information is presented in a clear and well-organized manner.
- **Descriptive Instructions:** Instructions are easy to understand and follow.
- **Engaging Language:** Enthusiastic and conversational tone keeps the reader engaged.
- **Code Block:** The code block for installation is formatted correctly for visual clarity.
- **Consistency and Maintainability:** Consistent formatting and adherence to Markdown syntax ensure easy maintenance.

I trust this enhanced README.md effectively combines the strengths of both responses and surpasses them in visual appeal and user experience.
